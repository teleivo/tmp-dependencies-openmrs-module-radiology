# Temp Dependencies OpenMRS Radiology Module

Dont get attached to me, I will disappear soon.

Am here to help out only a little while until the OpenMRS REST module releases
its new feature providing request parameter totalCount which is needed by the
OpenMRS Radiology Module and its lists powered by REST.

## Warning

Do not use the modules provided by this repo in production.

And if you use them its at your own risk.

I suggest you checkout

https://modules.openmrs.org/#/search

to get any module!
